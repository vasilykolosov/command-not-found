This extractor is based on the gnome-app-install-extractor.

It will only get links+xbits and write a dbm file. Run it
with:
./getExecAndSymlink.py /srv/archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/

and:
 cp edgy.db ../data/programms.d

This is just a intermediate solution until I have more time to dig
into the code of zyga.
