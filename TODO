ESSENTIAL

* Build a python+fuse virtual filesystem to create a sandbox chroot in which we will execute the postinst scripts
that might trigger update-alternatives. Current system cannot handle things like: update-alternatives $VARIABLE.
-> OR provide a list of those packages that use update-alternatives and 
      see if it can managed by hand
* Figure out if it's really true that NO SINGLE PACKAGE in dapper has any symlinks to binary files!?! (zk) - mvo: not true: gksudo -> gksu

TOP PRIORITY

* Create separate command-not-found--data package that is arch-dependent (mvo, please :-)
* collect if the data comes from "universe, multiverse" etc

MEDIUM PRIORITY

* Modify the build system so that POT creation date is not re-set every time a package is buil
  ZK: disabled from now on, manual: make -C po update-po is needed to sync translations
* Provide comprehensive suggestion database (sivang?)
  ZK: sivang is off the project for the moment

LOW PRIORITY

* Figure out why data (the empty directory) gets copied over /usr/share/command-not-found)
* Suggest packages for the currently used desktop before other packages
