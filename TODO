ESSENTIAL
* Figure out if it's really true that NO SINGLE PACKAGE in dapper has any symlinks to binary files!?! (zk) - mvo: not true: gksudo -> gksu

TOP PRIORITY

* Create separate command-not-found--data package that is arch-dependent [done]
* collect if the data comes from "universe, multiverse" and display this in 
  the UI!

MEDIUM PRIORITY

* Modify the build system so that POT creation date is not re-set every time a package is buil
  ZK: disabled from now on, manual: make -C po update-po is needed to sync translations
* Provide comprehensive suggestion database (sivang?)
  ZK: sivang is off the project for the moment

LOW PRIORITY

* Figure out why data (the empty directory) gets copied over /usr/share/command-not-found)
* Suggest packages for the currently used desktop before other packages
